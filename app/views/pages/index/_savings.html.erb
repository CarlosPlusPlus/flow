          How much does it cost?
        </h2>

        <p>
          Actually, possibly nothing!  With the help of our financing partners, who are as passionately committed to saving water as we are, we have been able to develop a program which is virtually cost free!
        </p>

        <p>
          With average savings from FLOW exceeding 25% , and the typical homeowners water/sewer bill at $100 per month â€“ you may very likely not have to come out of pocket to pay for the purchase and installation of FLOW.* In most cases, the savings and promotional incentives will exceed any required payments.

          Order now and start saving immediately upon installation!
