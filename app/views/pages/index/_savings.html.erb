        <p>
          While we cannot guarantee how much you will save in water usage and monthly bills, we are confident that you will see average savings of 25% - based on your typical, historic usage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our standard retail price is $599.99, but because of incentives we have been offered, we can drop the price down to $499.99, which includes installation by a trained technician under the supervision of a bonded, state-licensed plumber (normally a $100-$150 cost).
